# clj-spotify
clj-spotify is a client library for accessing the Spotify Web API. clj-spotify aims to be identical to Spotify's Web API when it comes to naming of endpoints, path elements and query parameters therefore the documentation found here is very short. Please read through the [Spotify API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/), a one to one mapping from the endpoints to functions in this library should be possible.

Please note that at the moment `clj-spotify 0.1.2` needs [cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire) as a dependency in your `project.clj`. See this [PR](https://github.com/blmstrm/clj-spotify/pull/4).

## Usage
Each function takes a map `m` of parameters and a sometimes optional oauth token `t`. Function names are the same as the names found in [Spotify's API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/). A function call to retrieve a track from Spotify then has the function signature `(get-a-track m t)` and a function call to get an album's tracks has the function signature `(get-an-albums-tracks m t)` and so on.

### map `m`
The map `m` holds both path elements and query parameters.
Key names and value types in `m` are the same as those found in [Spotify's API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) for path elements and query parameters. Integer values such as `:limit` and `:offset` can be specified either as integers or strings in `m`. 

### oauth token `t`
For a simple method to deal with authentication through the Client Credentials Flow see the `spotify-oauth-token` variable in `core_test.clj`. If you need oauth2 authentication through the Authorization Code Flow see this blog post on how to roll your own: [OAuth2 is easy - illustrated in 50 lines of Clojure](http://leonid.shevtsov.me/en/oauth2-is-easy). 

### Return values
clj-spotify returns the data received from the Spotify Web API unaltered but the response will be converted from json to a Clojure map.

### Error handling
Error messages received from Spotify are returned unaltered as received from the servers. If an API call would result in an exception in clj-spotify this will be returned on the same format as Spotify's error messages but with the `:status` key set to `Exception`and the result of calling `(.getMessage e)` on the Exception `e` associated with the `:message` key.

## Additional documentation
Each function has a basic doc string but if the usage still is unclear please consult [Spotify's API Endpoint Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/).
